  title: "Why is it so hard to get men engaged in parish life?"
  description: "You've tried everything: guest speakers, breakfast events, book studies. But the same challenges persist: Men sign up but don't show up, Groups start strong but fizzle out, Leaders burn out without support, No clear path from event to ongoing engagement. The result? Only 29% of Catholic men attend Mass weekly. And 15% report having no close friends at all."
